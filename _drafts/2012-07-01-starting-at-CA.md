Add Mainframe CA31 if it does not exist
---------------------------------------

# a CA31
# PDF // to go to ISPF/PDF Primary Option Menu
# 3.4 // to to to Data Set List Utility
# for Dsname Level -> CAREL06.PUBLIC.PDS.JCL, then press enter
# it lists the datasets, go to CAREL06.PUBLIC.PDS.JCL and do a view "v" 
# go to IBatsr2Z and type "v" first to view and then "sub" on the program to run it (this submits the job), port number is able when viewing the source code


 The check to see if it is running in the gui.
 
 
 start panel use "start" command
 F9 to switch betw two panels.
 open one panel as sysview
 and the other one as job view.
 in sysview
	st to list all my jobs
	refresh (enter | ref | st) to check if the job has executing
	go to the particular job and type "l" to list the different ddnames.
	press "s" to select stdout to view the logs
	
	
 
 swap list to display all panels.
 Trying to run the intertest program all day.
I have to follow the cheat sheet.
I need access to the mainframe server before I can begin.

Use sphinx and rst to do internal documentation.
Having trouble connecting to the SCM Broker.
Error Message: Unable to log into broker cscr801
Unable to initialize CA SCM.  Please ensure that all required components are installed.

To resolve this issue, Ravish provided me a new eclipse install to try out.
eclipse4sysdump.  This got around the SCM Broker issue.

Having issues following the instructions in "How to Install Eclipse Workstation for Testingtools".
It seems out of date.

When I try to import the said projects:
	com.ca.intertest.server
	intertest
	com.ca.sysdump.misc
	com.ca.sysdump.server
	testingtools
these projects don't exist.

Spoke to Ravish.  We don't need anything in sysdump for now. All the files exist in the TestingTools directory.

# Notes

# com.ca.intertest

Contains INtertestPlugin which extends AbstractUIPlugin.

# com.ca.intertest.admin
# com.ca.intertest.admin.feature
# com.ca.intertest.batch
# com.ca.intertest.batch.feature
# com.ca.intertest.cics
# com.ca.intertest.cics.feature
# com.ca.intertest.feature
# com.ca.intertest.installshield
# com.ca.intertest.product
# com.ca.intertest.rcp

This project requires the com.ca.intertest project.
Branding of the eclipse rcp app is also done here.
In the required plugin section, there are extra plugins that I have to investigate:

* com.ca.intertest - the main plugin that I have to look at
* org.eclipse.ui.cheatsheets
* org.eclipse.ui.forms
* org.eclipse.core.resources
* org.eclipse.update.configurator
* org.eclipse.update.core
* org.eclipse.u8pdate.ui

# com.ca.intertest.rcp.feature
# com.ca.intertest.runtime.feature
# com.ca.interteset.server.console
# com.ca.intertest.tools
# com.ca.intertest.updatesite
# intertest.mainframe
# intertest.setupThe first thing you need to do is call GIS up and get access to the mainframe server.
Richa mentioned getting access to ca11,ca31,tso and tpx. To confirm that I have access, there is a 
special telnet client called QWS2370 and I was able to login properly.
I then had to speak to Jim to make sure the server was up and running.
It was not, after he started it, the status of CA11 is "available".
I'm not sure what the next step is.

Richa was able to help me out but there are some stuff she redirected me to Jim P for.
Jim P is unavailable on IM currently.
I need some documentation on the Intertest Eclipse stuff.

2012-07-16
==========

* Worked on getting internal documentation setup.  Trying to get Sphinx Python Documentation Generator to work in my development environment.  The issue I'm having is that it doesn't work well in Windows.  I've installed VirtualBox (and Ubuntu image) to overcome this problem. Having issues with downloading the packages within the Ubuntu image, so I'll try do this at home since it might be a network issue. 
* James Pointsett sent a response regarding server settings, will try it out now. The server seems to be down again. Waiting for response.  This is kind of rediculous. Just try to setup a conference call to resolve this issue. 
* Trying to get a live meeting with Jim has been unsucessful.  I guess he is super busy. Will try again tomorrow.  But this is incredible frustrating since I am still unable to get Intertest to debug a file.  I've asked Richa for assistance but she refers me back to getting the answers to Jim.
* While I'm waiting for a response from Jim, I'm just going to try to replicate the intertest application as much as possible.  I've created a new RCP application and will be adding more plugins as I go.
* What I don't get is the fact that we had to extend the AbstractUIPlugin class (Intertest Plugin). Why does that have to be done.  Can't we just add views and editors via plugin.xml? Need to figure that out.
* Going through the tutorial Eclipse Extension Points and Extension Tutorial (http://www.vogella.com/articles/EclipseExtensionPoint/article.html).  Bought the eclipse 4 book by Vogella but the kindle format was trash.  I asked to get a refund for the book and they were nice enough.  I'll try again later on tonight to get a refresher on Eclipse 4 development.

2012-07-17
==========

* Still unable to run intertest.  Sent Jim another request to have a live meeting session. For now, 
I'm not going to get to worked up in getting the intertest app started.  
* OK, I've got the debugger started.  And I have a meeting with Jim to figure out the rest of the features tide to the app.  After this I can review how the RCP does these features.
* After the live meeting, I still don't have access to some of the files and that is the reason why I can't debug. going through the feature set with Jim, intertest is a full feature debugger. Pretty awesome and everything is working.  Intertestw is able to step through the code, you can watch variables, add breakpoints and such.
*  AD1DEV.INTERTDV.DEMO.PROTSYM <-- need to add this for later.  Don't have access to the code just yet
* Here are some notes that I took during the phone meeting:
	- It's better to set up the project to just monitor one file.  What I had before what have one project monitor multiple files and that was kind of confusing.
	- Not sure if the dragging variables to the watch view is working. Highlight a storage variablG
	- the JCL file determines which program is going to run.  IN the JCL provided by JIM, the JCL file pointed to the program CAMRCOBX.  I didn't have that file in my monitor list so nothing was happening during my debug session.  I had to add it manually..
* Read through Eclipse Plug-ins book and get really familiar with it.  Need to master this document before the end of two weeks is up.

2012-07-18
==========
* Working thru Chapter 2 of Eclipse Plugins.
* I've gone up to Chapter 6 of the Eclipse Plugins book but it I need to come up for air.
* Need to do an example or something to get myself out of the rut.
* Ugh, how come I can get started on this project.

2012-07-19
==========
* Yesterday, just trying to learn more about the product.  I was thinking of doing a newsgroup reader in eclipse as an example of what I can do.
* Also decided to continue using the Helios version of Eclipse since that is the version we are using for our customers.
* Update the mainframe password to "jonel123".

2012-07-20
==========
* Ravish gave me some powerpoint files regarding mainframe 101.  Will need to review those so that I have some familiarity.
* Need to really get to know the application.  Need to spend some extra time to go over the code and coordinate with the intertest source code.
* move to a backpack.  using the computer case is hard.  I'd rather use the backpack since it is easier to carry.  I just need a gel case for the dell when I do bring it home.
* it's hard just reading a book and trying to remember it.  need to apply what I'm reading 
* trying to just work with the eclipse text editor which does not support word wrapping.  That just sucks.  Maybe, I can create a simple plugin for that.
* It's already been developed https://github.com/ahtik/eclipse-wordwrap.
I'm not sure how to improve it.  It works pretty well.  My status notes are not word wrapped.
* I haven't really made any useful progress with the plugin.  Need to concentrate on the tasks.
* Don't forget to do your timesheets.
* Can't wait to get to 5pm already.  I haven't been too productive and yet I want to go home as early as possible.  I played a bit of ping pong with Renzo to pass the time away.  
* I'll do the timesheets at 4:30pm.
* still continue with the paleo diet.  how many meals are there in a week?
7 * 3 = 21 meals. no croutons on the salad and I have 4 meals covered. 

2012-07-23
==========

* Need to find a sample project that I can sink my teeth into to learn more about Eclipse programming.
* I'm just going to play around with a simple HelloWorld application.  It makes it easier for me to muck around with the functionality.  If I want to get more focused on an application, I can do that as well. 
* Learning the Eclipse's Commands API is more complicated than I thought.  I'm not sure why I"m not able to open the Favorites view via a Menu Command.
* This afternoon, I played basketball instead of doing the lunch workout series.  I think that was a mistake since I didn't get the cardio that I wanted.  Next time, just do the lunch series. And play basketball in the morning.
* Ok, the day is almost done.  I manage to get a close view of commands.

2012-07-24
==========

* work on interacting with the views and models today with regards to eclipse.  Updating the view based on model changes.
* created a simple rcp application.  now it's time to create a view.
* I know how to add the newly created view into the rcp app.. Need to add it to perspective.java
* Just finished working out and I feel great. I did some cardio during th eaerobic class and afterwards played a little bit of basketball. I feel great.  Working out in the afternoon is definitely better for me than in the morning. I'll do this instead.  How to be more efficient 
	- leave my sports shoes at the office and my shower stuff so I don't have to go back and forth. 
	- In the morning, I just need to prepare my workout clothes.  That should make what I carry every morning much lighter.
	- this also means, I can spend more time with the kids. I can do stuff with the kids in the morning.
* man, I"m getting so many business ideas in my head. Must be that blood rushing up my head.
* The next thing I have to do is tie my view to a model.

2012-07-25
==========

* continue to work on models and views
* get my access going on.
* Munish showed my the TPX.  Still so complicated and getting lost all around.I need to be more verse with the telnet client.  I still don't have the right access. That's why I talked to Scott and he mentioned that I delete my id and recreate it again.
* Notch programs in Eclipse on Windows.  I should just do the same thing.  Just try to follow Notch and see what he does. He is able to create a million dollar company with his game.  And his only tools were Java.
* Just focus on Java as the only language that you know.  That way you can become really fast with it.
* I still don't have access to Intertest.  This is such a pain in the ass.
* I've got a lot of hobbies that I'm thinking of.  Photography, Java Game Programming, Property Management Company. A lot of stuff to do. When do I have the time and energy to do all this tasks.  I sure hope I can do all this stuff while I'm at home.
* Join the Java4k contest to create a game.
* Get a good Java game programming book. SomethingG easy and light.

2012-07-26

* Here are the tasks:


* As an InterTest GUI user, I need the ability to import C listings into my project.
* As an InterTest QA Engineer, I need to set up an environment for testing the Eclipse plugin.
	- I'm willing to become the guinea pig to test for this.  As a new hire, I've had all sorts of trouble getting Intertest as an Eclipse plugin to work successfully.  Issues I have had to deal with include MainFrame permission issues and missing files needed in the workspace for the RCP to run.
	
* Worked with Munish to get his environment up but it is still not working.
	- Is there a corrupt file still, I don't think so.
	- I will try to replicate it tonight,
	- Try to figure out if I had to run a build.  But that shouldn't matter since it's an exact copy of what I'm doing.
	
2012-08-01
==========

* James Pointsett is PITA.  He seems to be sending out some rude emails. Are the PSE stuck up for some reason.
* Need to figure out why it's not working out for Munish.
* Ordered a headset today. I hope it's the right one.
* One of the task today is to figure out how to get the cisco softphone working.  So that I can use it during the meeting or when I am working from home.
* Talk to Mike regarding enrolling me in Boot Camp.  I feel so lost when people talk about the MF.
* Bring my Moleskine during the meeting to discuss, it's got my notes.
* Ok, I'm ready for the meeting with Mike.
* Ask for an instock monitor.
* Figure out what a DDS is.
* Damn, this kind of sucks waiting for 1pm.. I want the meeting to get started already.
* Create the Lode Runner app using the book found.
* Create the Lode Runner app using the Android book provided.
* What does it mean: "We created the workflow" regarding starting up Virtual Instance in the cloud.
* Ok, Just had a meeting with Mike.  My statement about me having three daughters didn't go over so well.  
* Damn, everybody has a click that they belong to.  Not sure where I belong to.
* THe meeting with Mike, we created the stories that needed to happen.
* I can do Eclipse plugins myself, I just have to be really good at it.

Some notes on Syntax Coloring:

Editor must override the getPresentationReconciler().
In the current codebase: ASM, COBOL and PLI implements this
These programs have a classes that extends AsmScanner.  The Scanner constructors are provided with Reserved words regex values for seperators.
        - AsmScanner
        - CobolScanner
        - PLIScanner
I don't see anywhere where it has anything to do with the protsym file.

Outline

- http://wiki.eclipse.org/FAQ_How_do_I_create_an_Outline_view_for_my_own_language_editor%3F
- needs IContentOutlinePage adapter which requires a ContentProvider, LabelProvider
- I looked at the source code and it's not easily understandable by me, need more research.
- They have a class called OutlinePage

2012-08-02
==========

- Left my keys at home.  PITA since I had to have Mike DuBois sign me in.
- I also played bball so I borrowed Ravish's key card.  Gotta thank him for that.
- Had the status meeting to discuss what I need to do for the rest of the month. 
- Munish was pretty anxious and got more of the task that I was assigned to do.
- I can't seem to access RTC online in the web. Freaking slow.
- Munish is going to take care of the server setup.  This will allow me to connect to the servers properly.
- created tasks for the story that I own.
- I"m not sure if that is it.
- Just figure out how that works.
- It's taking forever to update my local repository.

2012-08-03
==========

- SCM works properly with no issues.
- just trying to figure out which package it goes into.
- need to ask Vijay if he needs assistance  regarding Story 200.  Do we need to talk to Richa about how the package is delivered.
- may change the dom parser into the sax parser
- the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
- create a new junit test case for all the items that I work on.
- Munish said it will be Tuesday for the server to be up.
- Maybe I can use a temporary server from QA?
- Start using this machine as my main machine.  That way, I can get a better feel on the windows envinroment.
- For Monday's meeting, I need to mention that I need a server to connect to, to actually do a test.  Waiting up for Munish, it will take until Tuesday.  As a backup though, is there an alternative.
- provide a mechanism to get a sample of a protsym file.
- OK, I forgot to buy the other connector.  Just ordered it from CDW.  I should have bought the bundle first.  Yeesh.  That's resolved now and it's on order.
- I created the test cases, now I just have to deliver how it works.
- Am I replacing Charles Godwin as the main Eclipse programmer?  I sure hope so.  Paul Hurley is more of a mainframe guy so I don't think I am replacing him.
- Need to be familiar with the ByteBuffer class.  This is how the MemberInfo instance is constructed.
- Leave the house if not going to play basketball at 7:30am.  This allows me to be the first one in the office for the team. I'd leave early if there was no work to do.

Summary
I'm working on Story 899: As an INterTest GUI user, I need to be able to list the C members in my PROTSYM file.
Task Done:
* Isolated the files associated with being able to list the C members.
Road Block:
* Need to have a Intertest Server to connect to debug the Protsym file in Eclipse.
Currently working:
* While I wait for the server setup, trying to create test cases for the changes that needs to be made.
++++++

* looking into the dom parser into the sax parser
* create junit test case for all items worked on
* during status, mention the roadblock of connecting to server
* no need to buy pants for Friday.  I will just wear the same thing all the time.  Just wear dress pants and dress shirts.  This makes my life easier.  There is less decision making in the process.
* need the ability to write stories in the backlog.
	- wrote an email to Scott and Melissa about it.
* writing the test cases for the changes needed.

Status Meeting Notes:

What they have been working on since the last standup
What they intend to do today
What obstracles are standing in their way

* I need to focus on my Bball game.  And since I can't play in the morning.  I'll just play bball in the afternoon.  Maybe just do the cardio class on Wednesday.
* Can I create a test server on my local system.
* Decided not to play sports for the next two weeks.  Got to give my foot a rest.  AFter that, if the error occurs again, talk to an pediatrist.
* Need a test fixture to get the protsym file correctly.
* Use Mockito as my mocking utility.
* Trying to figure out how to integrate Mockito into y testing.
* Mockito allows me to create in instance of an interface and have it return whatever I want.  Do I really want this when testing eclipse?

2012-08-07
==========

I'm still on Story 899: List the C members in PROTSYM file.  I'm stilll trying to create a test case.
Again, the only obstacle I have is getting a Intertest Server.

* Go to a Baseball Game today
* DONE --> For the bugs that I find, create a task in the MISC Story.
* Using Find Bugs for static analysis.
* During the status meeting, I can probably connect using Madhuri's server
* I think it is just a matter of understanding the protsym file properly.
* Madhuri is taking a while to respond back.
* LoadListing.java is the main star of the program which loads the listing file.
    - need to understand this file and figure out the parts of the listing file.
    - set a debug statement at LoadListing.java first.  This will be my entry point to the code.
    - what does CVMO or CVMI mean?  The documentation sucks.
* So no paychecks this week.  Next week will be a big one. I needs to be able to connect to the server and get the member info.
    - that's a lot of setup code that needs to be done.
* No more bball for the next two weeks.  Need to rest my foot.
* How come I failed in Adeptra.  Was it b/c the location was too far away? I hope that was the case.  I didn't give up. I just didn't have the proper training.
* Playing for the first time in the game room.

     
2012-08-08
==========

* Jim mentioned to continue to work on setting up the Dev Environment.
* Asking Vijay if the server is down.

I'm unavailble to import the PROTYSYM file again.  Maybe there is a 30 minute lock or something.

What does ProtsymMessage mean, who do I speak to about understanding the ProtsymMessage?

==========

* Meeting with Charles Godwin about building install for Intertest V9
* Had the status meeting and mentioned to Scott what I did in the coffee room.
* Working with Vijay and found out that when importing a C file, it would not allow me to import the protsym file again.
* Can't import C file for now.
* Maybe go to the doctor and inquire about my foot.

LanguageAttribute.setValue
IAttribute.COBOL = 0x20
IAttribute.ASM = 0x10
IAttribute.PLI = 0x80
IAttribute.C = 0xa0

value as parameter = "10"
this.string = "ASM"

value as parameter = "a0"
this.string = "C"

value as parameter = "20"
this.string "COBOL"

value as parameter = "80"
this.string = "PL/I"

The files to modify

com.ca.intertest --> ImportListingPage
    - Do we need to add a member_c variable for the ViewLabelProvider class.
    

com.ca.intertest.tools --> 
    - IAttribute
        * need to add - public static final int C = 0xa0;
    - XMLConstants
        * need to add - public static final String C = "C";
    - LanguageAttribute
        * inside setValue(String value): 
            int mask = IAttribute.COBOL | IAttribute.ASM | IAttribute.PL1 | IAttribute.C;
                            break;
            case IAttribute.C:
                this.string = XMLConstants.C;
                break;

2012-08-13
==========

* finish up import protsym issue
* this is a new week.  focus on getting my story completed.
PL/1
String plc = member.getAttribute("gt_m_plc"); --> {gt_m_xa=0, time=2009/04/03 06:56:57, gt_m_lang=80, name=PL1DEML, gt_m_plc=3.20}
text = member_pl1.toString(plc); --> 3.20 
* Committed my changes regarding the programming language in the import protsym dialog box.
* spoke to Jim, the values for the versionstring coming from the server is null, need to fill those values in from the server. I'm waiting for this.
    - was trying to debug for the longest time but it turns out the protsym file needs to be filled in.

2012-08-14
==========

* don't forget to mention the issue about the missing menu item.  Munish should mention this.
* for Story 900, 
    - Member.java - look into constructor method Member(ProtsymMessage, Memberinfo)
    - BuildListing.java - build() // to parseC program
    - MemberInfo.java - add static int C = 0xa0;
    - created parseC class just so I wouldn't get any error.
* spoke to Jim Pointsett, the version info is still not being set.  He told me to wait on it.
* Story 900: As an InterTest GUI user, I need to be able to import C listings into my projects.
    -I should be able to select a C listing from a PROTSYM member list and have that listing downloaded and imported into my selected project.
    -I should be able to see that listing in the InterTest debug view as a monitored or unmonitored program.
* inside the run method of LoadListing, the gt_m_lang variable is a0.  so it is working when it goes into this method.

2012-08-17
==========
- talk to Jim and see if we can have a code review.
- how do you add the CA Conferencing Center into Live Meeting 
- Munish was able to resolve the gt_m_lang issue via the protsym file.
- he is working on the version option
- hopefully he gets that resolved soon.
- Jim mentioned that the version string is there.
    * the problem is that the version string is incorrectly parsed by the server.
    
2012-08-20
==========

* create new workspace usig InterTest 9.0
    - now that we have a new branch, we should do a sanity check to make sure there are no issues.  
    - for example, "create intertest batch" menu was not available before. makes me wonder what else
    - complete
* get the build machie MSI resolved today (from the status meeting)
    - spoke to Charles Godwyn and he will take care of creating an environent to create the build.
    - complete
* Access to LOD machine
    - godch01-VM17547 (10.130.230.195)
    - machine is not a member of the TANT-A01 domain, when logging in use "\"
    - I'm using the password Mon123Day

* Continue to work on the documentation
    - need to get this down today.
    - add a lot of screens captures.  the person is not suppose to know how to use the product.
    - we only need one Detailed Design specifications (DDS).  In the Preface, it says:
    - There can be many DDSs for each project, one for each major feature described in the Product Requirement Deocument (PRD).
    - The first draft of the DDS is complete.  It's just a bunch of screenshots pasted.
* 11:45 leave for the gym.  Go get a workout, need to exercise
    - went to the cardio class and did not play basketball.
    - i still feel my feet hurting. not the same as before.
    - i need to weigh myself to see if I'm super heavy weight.
    - do this for tomorrow as well as it is healthy and there is not much chance of injury.
    - after working out, i ate a burger and fries.  I'm not gong to lose weight this way.
    - need to reduce my calorie intake. maybe not have lunch at all.  I think I can get away with nothing having any lunch.

* Ask Therese if she has inquired with the insurance company about her hearing aids.
    - we need to make sure that it is paid off by the end of the month.
* Need to figure out how to work with the tpx.  I need to figure out the output of the mainframe code and the output of the tomcat code.
* Townhall meeting tomorrow.  Don't be late for work.  The townhall is at 9 in the morning.
* Don't ask for money from investors.  Need to derisk the product.
* The idea of a web app that does scheduling.  Allows text messaging confirmation and an easy way to find an alternate.
* which webapp does restaurant people finder?
    - market it first to see if you can get some clients.
    - don't develop the product, until you have some customers.
    - market and get customers.
    - maybe it's another income source, to be able to buy a nice car and buy a new house.
    - maybe ask Luisa how to market this app.
    - I'm very intersted in this since I think it would be really useful
    - Has to be super easy to use.

2012-08-21
==========

* ask Munish how he is coming along with the C program.
* look into the java server portion of intertest.mainframe.
    - need to understand how it works.
    - at least the java portion of it.
* trying to work with Charles.  The build machine is giving me java exceptions.  
* just got vi to work with 4 spaces as the tab.
    - source $MYVIMRC
    - e $MYVIMRC
* had a townhall meeting today.
    - always think about how to patent things
    - our numbers are low for the past quarter
    - Scott always dress to casual.  Too late for me as I already bought my wardrobe
      besides, there is no thinking about what to wear.  They all match. Grey/Black
      pants with whatever dress shirts with black shoes.
* install terminal plugin for my mac computer
* Look into protocol buffers: https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/
* Try to stay here longer than 5pm.  You can work on other stuff that are interesting. 
    - oh wait, i have to get the bed from Luisa.
- I did some cardio.  I tried playing bball and my feet felt kind of weird so I just passed on the game.  Need to conserve and make sure I don't make it any worse.  I gotta figure out how much I weigh.  I hope I don't weigh over 220.  If that is the case, need to lose super weight.
* Cool, Munish has the server information complete.  I've made my changes to eclipse and it is reflected in the "Import Protsym Wizard".  My workspace is rebuilt to latest and everything works now.
* One question to ask during the meeting is how best to transfer a zip file from the LOD machine for QA to review.
* just figure out the best way to share the files. Does qa have a shared server I can upload the zip files to?
* ok, all the work is pretty much finished.  i guess i can go home at 5pm. do some research about other projects that seem interesting.
* ok, I"ve got some free time. Wondering what I should be looking at?

2012-08-22
==========

* what i did yesterday:
	- we are now able to provide QA with a zip file for them to test
		- using the ant build for 8.5
		- need a place where we can upload the zip file to (server)
	- munish was working on the version string from the tomcat server side, i made the changes to reflect the eclipse gui side.
	- munish was suppose to ask regarding what the version string stood for.
* what i'm going to do today
	- just do a second review of everything from DDS document to code changes
* roadblocks
	- just waiting for the tomcat server code to be completed and we are ready to go and push it to qa
* maybe work with munish side by side regarding the c code.  an extra pair of eyes doesn't hurt.  
* verify with Charles about the server side code
	- we will build the server side code and deploy it to mainframe for them to view
* need to provide QA with a zip file and the server side code for them to test the stories.
	- send them an email
	- G
	- I will be deploying it to Vijay's shared directory.
* set up my chrome bookmarks.  this is permanent.  does it sync with my other bookmarks?
	- my investment in pinboard.in may have been a waste..  chrome bookmark sync is good enough for me	
* GIS Server ticket mount point has taken more than a week. man.  
	- this has got to get done.	
* Location of PROTYSYM File: AD1DEV.INTERTDV.DEMO.PROTSYM
* The C icon and C version is not showing up properly in the new build.  This needs to be tested again.
* Just came from the gym.. Spent an hour and a half at the gym working out. Ate a chicken caesar wrap to be healthy but bought a cookie afterwards as well. yeesh.

2012-08-23
==========
* What I did yesterday:
	- worked with Munish the latter part of the day
	- submitted eclipse build to QA
	- regression test issues, Charles Godwin has fixed
* What I will do today:
	- work on the version string in C
* Roadblock:
	- None
* Vijay did some regression testing and found a few differences with the build.
	- asked Charles to take a look at it as it could just be a simple build configuration fix.
* GIS has fixed the BPX access issue.  
	- asked Munish to help me set up my environment so I can deploy my own tomcat server
* Need Munish to also help me get around the TPX screen so I can see the debug messages and submit a job.
* For debugging purposes regarding the compiler version
	- I need Munish to show me how to get this screen information:
		- From Jim: You should see a version there now. It will x11, x12, x13. 
		- From Jim: I know the master record has a version number in it, make sure your server steplib is using the SYMCC Q2 libraries.

	1.  10 to go to CA31 (a ca31 if it doesn't exist)
	after loogging in add ca31.. then after a few enters pdf.
	2. 3.4 to go to data set list utility
	3. Dsname Level . . . CAREL06.PUBLIC.PDS.JCL
	4. view dataset (carel06.public.pds.jcl)
	5 sub IBATSR2Z
* ok, there is a discrepancy between the 8.5 and 9.0 branch.. when i try to build on the 9.0 branch, i get the error:

C:\Users\CAREL06\workspaces\intertest-90\intertest.mainframe\build server.xml:73: Could not create type ftp due to java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/commons/net/ftp/FTPClientConfig
* yey.. i'm able to build my server now.

2012-08-24
========== 
* Yesterday
	- Munish helped me install tomcat server
	- finally got the proper permissions from GIS to build from my local environment, i'm now able to build & deploy tomcat server
	- Submitted to QA Charle's fixes for the regression test 
* Today
	- The regression test fixes didn't seem to work so I'll investigate why and also resolve a missing icon issue that was found by Vijay
	- debug 899 on my local environment
* Roadblock
	- I need to review the code myself, but maybe on Monday we can have a powwow with Jim to iron the version string information.  If we are working together and presenting our findings, we can resolve the version string information info in no time.	 
* I'm not able to deploy and test changes to the protsym file.
	- let's start debugging and figuring out where the version information is coming from.

	- stop looking into frameworks until you have a product you want to build, get customers first
* leave at 4pm today.  I came in early and did the debugging for the 
* why do I need tomcat server to reside in the mainframe.  why can't i just run tomcat server locally on my machine.  
	- isn't that an easier option to do.
* Story 967 and 969 completed.  Had time to spare so looked at it and closed when completed.

	- Looking over the some tasks I created previously to fix up
	- for 899, if the expected values are coming in 0x11,0x12,0x13 we need to find the proper values to display as a string in the eclipse gui.
	- update the DSD to reflect the expected value
* Roadblock:
	- N/A
* Go to the cardio class for lunch.  And play some ping pong afterwards.  Need to refresh my mind.

	- what i will do today
		* i will be working on story 904 (outline view for C program)
		* change my USS prompt regarding build environment
	- roadblocks
		* n/a
* OutlinePage.java is the class that I have to look at.
	- investigate more to see what is happening.
	- parsePLI: [com.ca.intertest="true", dsn="AD1DEV.INTERTDV.DEMO.PROTSYM", gt_m_lang="80", gt_m_plc="3.20", gt_m_xa="0", name="PL1UEMO", records="8674", server="Eladio's Server", time="Unknown Date"]

	- look into LoadListing.run to see what the difference is between different programming languages
* my mind is mush right now, can't figure out what is going on.
* I woke up at 5 this morning, I guess that is still considered early.
	- when's the next episode of breaking bad?
	- i stay up till 10 to watch that last night.
	- as expected, he is going to get discovered.

2012-09-05
==========

* had a talk with Vijay regarding QTP, which is a cool program for testing in the windows environment.
* Write the DDS
	- looked over the Vijay's Test Document for Story 904 and providing more feedback
	- verify the completeness of the outline view.
* paid Joe S. $20 to participate in the deathpool league.
* updated the DDS for QA testing.
	- very rough.
* for the intertest.mainframe project, reliant on a specific version of ant.  have to use 1.7.1 instead of latest.
* my status is getting shorter and shorter
	- that's b/c I'm investigating how outlines work.
	- once I get how outlines work, i'm in the clear.
	
2012-09-06
==========

* focus on getting the outline up for the C program.
* yesterday:
	- updated dds for story 904
	- looking into the code for story 904
* today
	- review test plans that madhuri sent out and update DDS for the other stories
	- looking into the code for story 904
* roadblock
	- n/a
* playing bball today and getting some exercise.
* tree variable contains the member variables
	- the reload variable is the one that assigns it to the tree.
	- need to take a look at debugfile and see how it is parsed.
* in the cobol program that I just imported, not sure where "Procedure Division" is used.
	- need to investigate this a bit more.
	- but for now, let' figure out what shows in the C program.
* story 904 is on hold until the protsym file provides the symbol table.  can't construct the outline view for it.
* working on story 15309 for now.
* updated DDS QA Recommendations for Story 902.
* in Cobol, I can't seem to add a breakpoint, it is greyed out.
	- i can do it for a PL/1 program.
	- in ASM, the add breakpoint is also greyed out.
* questions about adding breakpoints, discuss with Scott and QA.

2012-09-07
==========

* worked on 904, that's on hold until I get the symbol table from the protsym file.
* Reviewed QA test plans and updated QA Testing Recomendations DDS for 902,15309 & 904.  
	- Will be working with Venkat after the meeting to tighten the scope of of 15309.
* roadblock - need symbol table from protsym file.
* for 15309
	- we want to focus on adding unconditional breakpoints for executable lines, thats it. (there are different types of breakpoints)
	- in the breakpoint view, we have all these icons.  (can we not focus on them during this story).  not sure what it means to configure settings.
		-configuring the breakpoint from unconditional to conditional.
	- what's add a global breakpoint?
* for 904
	- why can't we ask Jim to make it one of his priorities to complete by midweek.
	- in the code, when I'm building this tree it requires the symbol table.
	- for now, just have an outline with the root node going to main.  when you double click on main, it goes to the main method.
* Story 15646 is complete.  No need to 	write a DDS for this.
	- build process.  Charles Godwin worked on this.
* Get the outline view working by tonight.	
* Didn't get anywhere, I got stuck with the parsing the main class.	
* Don't play any basketball.  Just focus on getting this done.
    - gotta a lot of stories to finish.

2012-09-08
==========

* still working on story 904 outline view.  
    - had complications parsing out the main method.

2012-09-10
==========

* working on the outline view.
	- provide an outline for a c program where you can click on a C main method.
	- i've got the main method to show up in the outline view.  
	- just have to configure it so that when you double click on it, it goes to the right file location
* need to be able to view different C programs and go to the main method.
    - need to make sure I am doing this properly within the code, no hackjob.
* might need to pick up Therese after work.
* need to buy a camera soon.  Olympus OM-D

2012-09-11
==========

* for the camera
    -figure out if to buy one with no lens and buy a separate lens for it.
* finish up the outline view
    - need to determine the line of the main program or use the first executable statement, whichever is easier to implement
    - update the story's acceptance criteria
    
2012-09-12
==========

* need to really research what's going on in the code.  I'm not sure how information is passed from parseSource to the outline view.
    - the outline view get's its information from a debugfile
* information is contained in a zip file which includes two files
    - metadata >> the metadata contains the parsed information
    - listing >> the listing is the actual source file    
    
    public void addMainToCProgram(String lineNumber) {
        Element member = getFirstMember();
        NodeList nodelist = member.getChildNodes();
        for(int i=0; i < nodelist.getLength(); i++) {
            Node node = nodelist.item(i);
            if(node.getLocalName().equalsIgnoreCase(XMLConstants.SYMBOLS)) {
                Element childElement = newMember(XMLConstants.STRUCTURE);
                childElement.setAttribute("level", "-2"); 
                childElement.setAttribute("linenumber", lineNumber);
                childElement.setAttribute("name", "main");
                childElement.setAttribute("offset", "0");
                childElement.setAttribute("statementnumber", "1");
                node.appendChild(childElement);
            }
        }
    }

2012-09-13
==========

* story 904 complete
    - i'll make a build tonight for QA Testing
    - if you want all the method to be shown in the outline view it will take more time
      right now, it's just the main method
* moving unto story 15309, adding breakpoints

* need to submit build for QA > almost done
* work on adding breakpoints
    - Thanks to Charles, Look into RulerBreakpointAction
    - popup.add = Add Breakpoint
* need to figure out what are actions? i know what editors are, what views are.. but haven't worked much with actions
* RulerBreakpointAction.update determines if the line should have a context menu disabled or enabled.2012-09-17

 right now the issue is with the linenumber.. the linenumber value being put in the statement is always 0.
 this screws it up.

==========

* Munish mentioned that he will be done by tomorrow.
* Adding / Removing Breakpoints on Executable lines is complete.
 
2012-09-19
==========
 
* finished up the add breakpoint issue
* once issues with the build process has been resolved, we will be pushing it to QA for testing for all stories.
* will work on improving the syntax hightlighting today and generate a better outline.
* working on the c parser by creating an AST
* finally got all my projects not have any errors.  The only issue was that I have to create a BuildProduct project which
includes the apache tomcat jars.

2012-09-20
==========
* Submitted new build to QA yesterday 
* Look into for today:
    > look into 2 main methods in C code issue.
    > add line breakpoints issue.

For ADDPOS, Line 11 has a statement type of LABEL, it is not part of the VerbListing
For ADDN, Line 5 has a statement type of NOOP, it is not part of the VerbListing

The question to ask right now is why Line 5 is a statement type of NOOP and the other one is ADDPOS

2012-09-21
==========

* Look into the outline view.. The AST parser is the real fix to the solution
* Created a filecalld ParserExample which is able to parse a C file pretty quickly.
    - I haven't checked it in but it looks good.
    - This can work in the outline view.
* The next step to figureout how to use the syntax hightlight.
* Trying to install virtualbox again.
    - Uninstalled again b/c installation was too slow.
    - It's taking more than an hour too complete.
    - Forget about it.
* I'll just continue to work on the mac.
* Instead of an ipad for development, the next machine that I should be using is a macbook air.
    - Using ipad / keyboard might sound cool but it's too big of a stretch.
    - After thinking about it, just get a macbook air
    
2012-09-24
==========

* for story 904, no more work until next story.
* keep working on CDT parsers

2012-09-25
==========

* yesterday, able to parse comments and functions through CDT jar files
* keep working on CDT parser
* prepped with Munish regarding the demo for tomorrow.
* still working on CDT implementation
* need to test out Charles Godwin latest changes.
    - will do the test tomorrow after the demo

2012-09-26    
==========

* demo today
    - it starts at 9:00am so I can't be late.
    - i won't be able to drop off javi at school tomorrow.
* review the upcoming stories
* review the server changes made by Charles Godwin <-- told Munish about this
* adding the class ParserCDT into com.ca.intertest.tools

2012-09-27
==========

* need to add tasks to the stories
    - this is complete
* let's work on the syntax highlighting

==========

* created tasks in the stories that I'm involved with
* need to write the DDS and QA Recommendations for 903
* have to test with the actual RCP plugin rather than using main.
    - the jar files keep getting messed up
Munish's Old Code:
//          if (cWords.containsKey(word))
//          String lowerCaseWord = word.toLowerCase();
//          System.out.println("I am in Reserved Word: " + lowerCaseWord);
//          if(lowerCaseWord.equals("main")) {
//              System.out.println("this is the main keyword");
//          }
            
//          System.out.println(cWords);
             
            if (cWords.containsKey(word)){
//                  System.out.println("Found -> "+lowerCaseWord);
                b = true;
            }//else{
//              System.out.println("Not");
//          }//containsKey(word))


How does position work.  Position is line based.

000001 - offset: 1, length: 6
include - offset: 11, length: 7
stdio - offset: 20, length: 5


Who sets the content type..  teh determines if it's a commentsToken or a defaultToken.
Look into contentType

* Running out of ideas.  Need to get this resolve fast but taking a break for now.
* Yeah, ready to work on breakpoint initialization
* Added Munish Kumar as adminstrative user.  And created document to show how to log in.  Push in into Clarity.
* having mainframe issues, can't get started in debugging the code.
- go to sysview to purge the running programs
- in the edit JCL -> CAREL06.PUBLIC.PDS.JCL(ITBATCH7)
  the exec field should should be changed to the program you want it to run as.
  my server is now connected at CA11: 19459

* Vijay's Issues Regarding Syntax Highlighting:
	Factoril:
	- function prototypes not yet supported
	Globalvar:
	- function prototypes not yet supported
	Basic:
	- function prototypes not yet supported
	- statement # 9 - invalid C syntax
	- statement # 23 - invalid C syntax
	DivZero:
	- function prototypes not yet supported
* Work on breakpoint initialization
* I want to debug Hello.. This is the simplest program that I see.

// What does this do?
// For the C program,the found variable is "false". 
// For the cobol program, the found variable is "true".

	    if (!session.isDataMonitorOK()) {
	        if (session.isBatch()){
                boolean found = false;
                for (debugFile file : session.getMonitored(true)){
                    if (file.isDataMonitor()) {
                        found = true;
                        break;
                    }

* Madhuri was able to step trough and breakpoint a batch program.
* Ask Munish to do a CICS app breakpoing testing.
* Resolved "#define syntax highlighting"
* Resolved function prototypes.  That is finished now.
* Learn to figure out how to use VIM effectively.  Don't bother with Pycharm or any other editor.
	- keep honing your skills with VIM.  It will get better.

2012-11-02
==========

* created story for debugging cics and in the outline view changes from C to ASM
* Debug a program in INTERTEST BATCH
==================================
support.ca.com

1) In PDF, go to COMMAND (6)
2) Enter in the command prompt "EX 'CAREL06.CLIST(INTBAT)' 'QA'
3) Go to Foreground
4) In CA-IntertTEst Batch EXECUTION CONTROL Panel
	a) you should specify the PGR (CAMRC)
	b) specify the task library 'KUMMU03.INTBAT90.CURRENT.LOAD787'
5) In CA-InterTest Batch MONITOR CONTROL Panel
	a) in monitored programs, specify the program(s) you want to monitor
	b) Specify theSymbolic (PROTSYM) Files --> 'KUMMU03.PUBLIC.MK.INTBT9S4.PROTSYM'
	
				
Debug a program in INTERTEST CICS
=================================

1) Monitor a program first
	a) go to sysview
	b) look for CICS 
		1) I'm looking specifically for CICSTA67
		2) for that program "s" for select then "enter"
		3) look for the applid.  in this case, it is A11TITA7
	c) SHIFT-F12 to go back to TPX menu
	d) a A11TITA7
	e) in the CICS menu, click on "+" to clear the screen 
	f) run ITST
	g) 2 for Monitoring
	h) 1 in CA InterTest for CICS r8.5 MONITORING MENU
	i) in CA InterTest for CICS r8.5 PROGRAM MONITORING, you can enter CDEMO in Program and add "S" in "Monitor"
	
2) Then run the program
	a) press "+" to clear
	b) CDEM
	

Start the Tomcat Server
=======================

1) Go to either CA11 or CA31 (CA11 is more stable)
2) PDF // to go to ISPF/PDF Primary Option Menu
3) 3.4 // to go to the data set list utility
4) for DSNAME LEVEL --> CAREL06.PUBLIC.PDS.JCL, then press enter
5) it lists the datasets, go to CAREL06.PUBLIC.PDS.JCL and do a view "V"
6) go to IBATSV2Z and type "V" first to view and then "sub" on the program to run it 
   (this submits the job), port number can be found when viewing the source code.
   
Using Sysview
=============

start panel use "start" command
F9 to switch btwn two panels
open one panel as sysview
and the other one as job view
in sysview
	- "st" to list all my jobs
	- refresh (enter | ref | st) to check if the job has been executing
	- go to the particular job and type "l" to list the different ddnames.
	- press "s" to select stdout to view the logs

Misc
====

- "swap list" - list ot display all panels

Debugging CICS with Madhuri Session
===================================

- from TPX menu --> go to command --> "a a11tita6"
- clear the screen, using the "+"
- itst < -- start the intertest
- option 2 --> monitoring
- option 1 --> programs
- for program --> COBDEMO // select "S" for monitor
- "request has been processed"
- PF3 to back out of the screen until it says "ITST transaction ended"
- run the program DEMC
- press ENTER key to begin the demo
- in the keep window, modify the TASKNUM variable to "000000." and press ENTER
- press "GO"

ASMDEMO --> DEMA
PL1DEMO --> DEMP
CDEMO --> CDEM


These two servers have to be available

CICSTA66 CA11:11506
QA IntBat 9.0 CA11:19190

Import COBDEMO
Use QA IntBAt 9.0 server
