* discuss the EclipseCon presentation.  
    - provide initial summary
    - provide ppt summary
    - when is the next factory meeting (just need to nail down the date)
* archive story (development goals)
    - getting more complicated since we are discussing internal implementation
      (threads / new session id / waiting for the response everytime for both
       scenarios)
        * little bit worried that the story might be too large
          and might not be able to finish
    - research task is almost complete..
    - started task to create the archive dialog box.
* agile methodology (improve product innovation and quality)
    - i still think we could get better at creating stories and making it more smaller.
      during the stories, maybe we should discuss implementation details further.
      that way it get's a better sized.  Usually, the response is "that's implementation
      we can worry about that later".
    - US team members are great.  I'm communicating with Guy and Kip for the backend.
      People in Islandia (Ravish / Richa / Mahi) we are always talking.
    - i like the format of the status meetings, where we discuss based on stories
      rather than by people (story based rather then people based)
    - ordered/got the book "Succeeding with Agile", will read it when i need a break
    - i think we should have code review sessions with the team from prague as well as here
      currently we don't have any practice in place.
    - no pair programming either but I think that is ok since we are focused on our stories
      nobody has really asked for help yet.
